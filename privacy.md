## Data Collection and Usage
Jenkins Tray does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to us or any third parties.

### 1. User Credentials
The application requires your Jenkins URL, username, and password/token to function.
- **Storage:** These credentials are stored securely on your device using the **macOS Keychain**.
- **Usage:** They are used solely to authenticate with your specified Jenkins instance directly from your device. We do not have access to these credentials.

### 2. Job Data
The application stores a list of the Jenkins jobs you choose to monitor.
- **Storage:** This data is stored locally on your device in `UserDefaults`.
- **Usage:** This data is used only to display the job status within the application.

### 3. Network Activity
The application communicates **directly** with the Jenkins server URL you provide. No traffic is routed through our servers.

## Third-Party Services
Jenkins Tray does not use any third-party analytics, tracking services, or advertising frameworks.
